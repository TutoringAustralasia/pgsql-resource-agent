How to install this resource agent
==================================

This agent is written in perl. Its installation process follow the perl common
method, but its installation path follow usual path used for OCF libraries and
scripts.

Prerequisite
------------

The perl popular method to install packages is to use Module::Build. Depending 
on the system, you might need to install a package:
  * under Debian and derivatives, you need ``libmodule-build-perl``
  * under RHEL and derivatives, you need ``perl-Module-Build``

Quick install
-------------

The quick installation process is:

```
./Build.PL
./Build
sudo ./Build install
```

This process is supposed to detect the root of your OCF files (aka. OCF_ROOT)
and install the following files in there:

  * $OCF_ROOT/lib/heartbeat/OCF_ReturnCodes.pm
  * $OCF_ROOT/lib/heartbeat/OCF_Functions.pm
  * $OCF_ROOT/lib/heartbeat/OCF_Directories.pm
  * $OCF_ROOT/resource.d/heartbeat/pgsqlms

Moreover, if the build process find an ocft config folder (usually
``/usr/share/resource-agents/ocft/configs/``), it will install the "pgsqlms"
config file in there.


Build.PL arguments
------------------

The first Build step (call of Build.PL) accept two arguments:

  * ``--with_ocf_root=PATH``: give the location of OCF_ROOT to the Build process
  * ``--with_ocft_confs=PATH``: give the location of the ocft config files

They are usually not required as Build.PL should detect their location by
itself.

Testing
-------

See t/README to learn more about ocft tests.

Testing the user agent
=======================

1/ you need to install the resource-agents package of your distribution. This
   package contains the "ocft" script needed to run these tests.

2/ if needed, export the following environment variables:

     PGDATA        (default is /tmp/pgdata1)
     PGBIN         (default is /usr/pgsql-9.3/bin)
     RESOURCE_NAME (default is pgsqld)

3/ you might need to create the HA_RSCTMP folder. Usually: 
"/var/run/resource-agents/"

4/ to build the test scripts, run the following command as root:

     ocft make pgsqlms

5/ to actually run the tests, run the following command as root:

     ocft test pgsqlms

6/ to have some debug, run:

     ocft test -v pgsqlms


For more informations, see : ocft -h

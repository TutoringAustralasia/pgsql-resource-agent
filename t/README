Testing the user agent
=======================

1/ you need to install the resource-agents package of your distribution. This
   package contains the "ocft" script needed to run these tests.

2/ if needed, export the following environment variables:

     PGDATA        (default is /tmp/pgdata1)
     PGBIN         (default is /usr/pgsql-9.3/bin)
     RESOURCE_NAME (default is pgsqld)

3/ to build the test scripts, run the following command as root:

     ocft make -d your-pgsql-resource-agent-root/t pgsqlms

4/ to actually run the tests, run the following command as root:

     ocft test pgsqlms
